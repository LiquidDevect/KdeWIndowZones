#KDE Window Zones
*Create custom KWin shortcuts to move windows to specific zones*

Run the `GenerateScript.py` python program to generate your KWin script

`ClearShortcuts.py` will delete all KdeWindowZones shortcuts because KDE doesn't delete shortcuts after uninstalling a script

The generated script is based on lucmos' UltrawideWindows
